The provided code will result in a compilation error. In Java, when you try to concatenate different types using the + operator, the compiler expects a common type for the operation. In this case, you are trying to concatenate an int (a), a double (b), and a String (c). Since String has the highest precedence in such operations, the compiler tries to convert the int and double to strings and then concatenate them with the third string.

However, the issue is that you have used double quotes (“”) instead of regular double quotes ("") when initializing the String variable c. In Java, only regular double quotes are valid for defining a string literal. So, the corrected code should be:

java
Copy code
int a = 10;
double b = 20.2;
String c = "Hello";
System.out.println(a + b + c);
With this correction, the code will compile and run without errors. The output will be:

Copy code
30.2Hello
In this output, the integer a and double b are first added together, resulting in the double value 30.2. Then, the String c is concatenated to the result. The result is a String concatenation of "30.2" and "Hello".
